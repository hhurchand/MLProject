When the code is run it produces
(1) . The performance graph of the five classifiers tested
    (a) GaussianNB
    (b) KNN
    (c) SVC (with RBF)
    (d) SVC (with degree 5 polynomial)
    (e) SVC (with linear)
    
(2). The heat map is also displayed
      Not to show : Comment line 51 to 54
(3)(i). The graph of the PCA components are also shown.
      Not to show : Comment line 92 to 95
      
3(ii). The variance explained by the two components are also printed out.
      
      
(4). KFold is used to fix KNN hyperparameters. Remove comments from line 58 to 72 to activate.
